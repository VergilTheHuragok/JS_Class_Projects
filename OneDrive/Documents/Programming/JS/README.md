This repository includes all the working JS projects which I threw together for a programming class in my Junior year of high school.  
  
A couple of things:

The organization found here is mostly going to be rather aweful.  
  
Everything here was written on a deadline and while I was still learning. That's my best excuse.  
  
Oh, and the libraries located here in various projects are not mine. They can be found [here](https://p5js.org/libraries/).
